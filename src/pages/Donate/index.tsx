        Our new payment processor offers a very low fixed fee for direct
        debiting of bank accounts compared to their fees for credit card
        transactions. A very easy way to contribute to our team of stellar
        athletes is to set up recurring monthly donations through your bank
        account, making donations easier as well as contributing more of your
        actual gift towards helping the athletes.
